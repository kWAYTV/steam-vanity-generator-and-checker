# Steam User/Group Vanity Generator & Checker
 Tool to generate and check steam vanity's, with modes depending on what you need.
# Set up
Edit the tool and search for `mode` and `apiKey` (get one from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey))<br />
Modes are: `og = both modes / check = check only mode / gen = generate only mode`<br />
Tool will output everything in console with a fancy ui and save it on text files.
# To-do
Threading when checking and more ways to get + combinations or words from another word to generate more types of vanity's + group vanity checker.
